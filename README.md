# Language-Constructor
These set of Markdown files will help you construct a fictional language or languages. 

The inner core contains most words that glue the English language together. The outer core will handle most adjectives as well as ther verb, adverb and noun counterparts. 

This repository is incomplete for now. I will not be assisting in most nouns as there are so many to count, so it's up to you as the developer to add missing words yourself. 

**Take note that these Markdown files will not parse correctly in a Markdown reader. They are written like this on purpose. **
